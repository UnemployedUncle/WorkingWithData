## 3-2. Why business is in this section?
When I was on the bench (relaxing period between consulting projects),
I had a experience to find all of the labs (mostly top schools) in Korea related to ML, DL for recruiting purpose.
I just figure out that there are so many labs full of smart students.

Then what would be my core competence to beat them? I should utilize what I had learned.
There's such limitations studying other contents. However it can be my strong points.
